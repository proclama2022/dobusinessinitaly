## Understanding Italy's Progressive Tax System

Italy operates a progressive income tax system called IRPEF (Imposta sul Reddito delle Persone Fisiche), which applies different rates to different portions of your income. This means you don't pay the highest rate on your entire income—only on the portion that falls within each bracket.

### 2025 IRPEF Tax Brackets

| Income Range | Tax Rate | Cumulative Tax |
|--------------|----------|----------------|
| €0 - €28,000 | 23% | €6,440 |
| €28,001 - €50,000 | 35% | €14,140 |
| €50,001+ | 43% | Variable |

**Example: €75,000 annual income**
- First €28,000: €6,440 (23%)
- Next €22,000: €7,700 (35%)
- Remaining €25,000: €10,750 (43%)
- **Total tax: €24,890**
- **Effective rate: 33.2%**

### Tax-Free Thresholds and Deductions

The Italian system includes several deductions that significantly reduce your effective tax rate:

- **Employees**: €8,500 tax-free threshold + €1,000 additional deduction for income between €20,000-€32,000
- **Self-employed**: €5,500 tax-free threshold
- **Pensioners**: €8,500 tax-free threshold + special retiree benefits

**Important**: Regional and municipal taxes (addizionali) add 0.9% to 2.1% to your total tax burden, varying by location.
