# How to Open a Business in Italy as a Foreigner: Complete Guide 2025

Opening a business in Italy represents an extraordinary opportunity for many foreign entrepreneurs. Our country offers a dynamic market, interesting tax incentives, and increasingly simplified procedures. Whether you are an EU citizen or a non-EU citizen, this guide will accompany you step by step towards the realization of your entrepreneurial project.

## Requirements for Foreigners: EU vs Non-EU

The first fundamental distinction concerns your nationality. If you are a citizen of an EU country, the process is much simpler. You can start your business under the same conditions as an Italian citizen, without particular bureaucratic constraints.

For the first three months, you will only need a valid identity card. Subsequently, you will need to register with the registry office of the municipality where you intend to reside and make a declaration of presence at a police station. You will not need any specific residence permit for self-employment.

The situation changes significantly if you come from a non-EU country. In this case, you will need to obtain a residence permit for self-employment, which is essential to carry out any entrepreneurial activity. The Chamber of Commerce will need to issue you a certificate confirming your economic and financial capacity, demonstrating that you possess at least **€23,532 annually** (amount updated for 2025).

## The Investor Visa: A Preferred Path

If you have substantial capital, Italy offers a special program called the **Investor Visa**. This two-year visa is dedicated to those making strategic investments in our country. The minimum thresholds start from:

- **€250,000** for innovative startups
- **€500,000** for Italian capital companies
- **€2 million** for government bonds

The process is fully digitized through the government portal, with guaranteed response times within 30 days. Once you obtain the visa, you can travel freely in the Schengen area and reside in Italy for the entire duration of the permit.

## Which Corporate Structure to Choose

Choosing the legal structure is a crucial decision for the success of your business. Each corporate form has specific advantages and disadvantages that you need to evaluate carefully.

### Sole Proprietorship: Simplicity and Cost-Effectiveness

The sole proprietorship remains the most economical solution to start. It does not require minimum capital, and the opening costs range between **€150 and €300** if you rely on an accountant. However, you must consider that you will be personally liable for business debts, a significant risk.

### Limited Liability Company: The Most Popular Choice

The **SRL** (Società a Responsabilità Limitata) represents the preferred corporate form among foreign entrepreneurs, and for good reasons. While it requires a share capital of **€10,000** (although you can start with just **€1** and gradually reach the threshold), it offers protection of personal assets and greater credibility with banks and suppliers.

The total costs of establishment range between **€2,500 and €3,000**, including notary fees, taxes, and accountant fees. This is an investment that pays off quickly due to the increased ease of access to financing and commercial contracts.

### Simplified Limited Liability Company: The Economic Alternative

For those with limited budgets, the **SRLS** (Società a Responsabilità Limitata Semplificata) represents an interesting alternative. With a capital ranging from **€1 to €9,999** and reduced establishment costs of only **€320-410**, it offers many advantages of the traditional SRL. The only limitation is the inability to customize the statute, as you must use a standard ministerial model.

## The Most Promising Sectors for Foreigners

Analysis of official data reveals interesting trends in the entrepreneurial choices of foreigners in Italy. **Commerce** remains the most popular sector, representing **25.5%** of new foreign businesses. Many choose:

- Clothing stores
- Specialty food stores focusing on ethnic products
- Import-export activities that leverage connections with their countries of origin

The **construction** sector attracts **21.6%** of foreign entrepreneurs, often specializing in renovations incentivized by government building bonuses. **Personal services** also show steady growth, particularly successful in:

- Ethnic cuisine restaurants
- Beauty centers
- Domestic assistance services

## Flat-Rate Tax Regime 2025: An Opportunity Not to Be Missed

The flat-rate tax regime represents one of the greatest attractions of the Italian tax system for small businesses. With the 2025 budget law, significant new features have been introduced that make this regime even more interesting for foreigners.

- **Maximum revenue limit**: €85,000 annually
- **Employee income threshold**: increased to **€35,000**

This means that even those with a part-time job can open a flat-rate VAT number.

The taxation is extremely advantageous:

- only **15%** substitute tax
- which drops to **5%** for the first five years if you are under 35 and start a new business

For non-EU foreigners, access is possible as long as you reside in an EU country or the European Economic Area and generate at least **75%** of your income in Italy.

## Startup Costs: Plan Your Budget

Accurate financial planning is essential for the success of your business. Mandatory costs include:

- **Registration taxes**: €200
- **Stamps**: €165
- **Chamber fees**: €90
- **PEC**: €30-60 annually

In addition, there are accountant fees:

- from **€150** for opening a simple VAT number
- up to **€2,000** for establishing an SRL

Don't forget banking costs:

- Business current account: **€10-50** monthly
- POS for electronic payments: **€10-30** per month

These tools are now essential for any commercial activity.

## Step-by-Step Procedure

The opening process consists of well-defined phases.

### Document Preparation

This requires particular attention: all foreign documents must be **translated by official translators** and **legalized** with an apostille or by the Italian consulate.

- Costs: **€25-50** per page for translations
- **€16-60** for legalizations

### Choosing the Corporate Form

This should be made in consultation with a specialized accountant, who can advise you on the optimal solution for your specific situation.

### Actual Establishment

- Opening a VAT number
- Registering with the Business Register
- Registering with social security agencies

### Final Phase

- Opening a business bank account
- Activating mandatory digital services
- Obtaining specific authorizations for your sector

The entire process generally takes **4-6 weeks** if everything is prepared correctly.

## Available Incentives and Funding

Italy offers numerous support tools for new businesses:

- **New Businesses at Zero Interest**: finances up to **90%** of the investment for young people under 35 and women (max €1.5 million)
- **Resto al Sud**: incentivizes investments in southern regions
- **Regional programs**: non-repayable grants

**Innovative startups** enjoy special benefits:

- exemption from stamp duties
- tax credits for research and development
- easier access to investment funds

**Female entrepreneurship** can count on dedicated tools through the **Fondo Impresa Donna**.

## Banking Services for Foreign Entrepreneurs

The Italian banking sector has adapted to the needs of foreign entrepreneurs:

- **Extrabanca**: the only bank specialized for foreigners, offers services in 14 languages
- **Digital banks** like **N26 Business** and **Revolut Business**: rapid online openings with competitive costs and integrated international services

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

Experience shows that many foreigners make avoidable mistakes:

- **Documentation**: lack of certified translations or legalizations can block the entire process
- **Corporate Strategy**: choosing an inadequate corporate form or underestimating management costs
- **Taxation**: failure to optimize available incentives or incorrect choice of tax regime

👉 A **specialized accountant for foreign clients** can make a difference in preventing these issues.

## Conclusions

- careful preparation
- choosing the right legal and tax structures
- support from competent professionals

Italy offers a favorable ecosystem for foreign entrepreneurs, with **significant incentives** and **increasingly digitized procedures**.

The Italian market rewards those who can interpret local needs while maintaining their cultural specificities. With the right planning and determination, your entrepreneurial idea can become a **success story** in the Bel Paese.
