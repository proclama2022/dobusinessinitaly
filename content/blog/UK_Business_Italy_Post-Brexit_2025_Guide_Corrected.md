## Key Takeaways for UK Entrepreneurs

- **UK nationals are now third-country citizens**: This means mandatory visas, residence permits, and additional business setup requirements that demand careful planning and local expertise.
- **VAT compliance became stricter in 2025**: New cross-border VAT schemes and fiscal representative requirements for UK businesses need specialized accounting support.
- **Double taxation treaty remains active**: But practical implementation requires more documentation and proactive management to avoid unnecessary tax burdens.

Are you considering expanding your UK business to Italy or starting a new venture after Brexit? You're not alone. Despite the new regulatory landscape, over **2,200 UK-owned companies registered in Italy during 2024**, with growth continuing into 2025. This comprehensive guide will help you navigate the challenges and leverage the opportunities that await British entrepreneurs in Italy.

## How Brexit Fundamentally Changed UK-Italy Business Relations

The transition from EU membership to third-country status has introduced several significant changes for UK entrepreneurs. The most impactful transformation affects your legal status: **UK citizens are now treated as non-EU/EEA nationals** under Italian law, impacting everything from business registration to banking relationships.

Recent 2025 VAT reforms have added another layer of complexity. The Italian Budget Law implemented new cross-border VAT measures affecting UK businesses, particularly those operating across multiple EU markets. **The special cross-border scheme for small businesses** allows UK-owned businesses with EU-wide taxable sales below €100,000 to benefit from VAT exemption, provided they respect each nation's threshold (not exceeding €85,000 annually).

## Navigating Visa and Residence Permit Requirements

For stays exceeding 90 days, UK nationals must secure appropriate authorization before conducting business activities in Italy. The process varies depending on your business model and investment capacity:

### Italy Startup Visa Route
- **Minimum investment requirement**: €50,000
- **Business plan approval**: Required from Evaluation Committee
- **Duration**: 1-year initial visa, renewable upon demonstrated progress
- **Processing time**: 30-45 days
- **Application fee**: €116 for national D-visa

### Elective Residence Visa for Entrepreneurs
- **Financial requirement**: Demonstrated passive income or substantial business funds
- **Annual renewal**: Required with proof of ongoing business activity
- **Cost**: €70-€100 per year for residence permit renewal

### Short-Term Business Travel
**Current Status 2025**: UK citizens can travel to Italy visa-free for business purposes up to 90 days in any 180-day period. **The Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA/ETIAS) is NOT yet in effect for UK citizens** as of November 2025. No additional costs or applications are required for short-term business visits.

## Company Formation: Updated Requirements for UK Citizens

The business registration process now requires additional steps for UK nationals. Here's what you need to know about establishing your Italian entity:

### Popular Business Structures

**SRL (Società a Responsabilità Limitata) - Limited Liability Company**
- **Minimum capital**: €10,000 (traditional) or €1 (simplified SRL semplificata)
- **Capital deposit requirement**: At least 25% must be deposited in an Italian bank
- **Setup timeline**: 4-6 weeks for UK nationals (vs 2-3 weeks for EU citizens)
- **Notarization costs**: €1,000-€2,000 for document processing

**Branch Office vs Subsidiary**
Many UK businesses opt for a subsidiary rather than a branch, as subsidiaries provide limited liability and are treated as separate Italian tax residents, potentially offering better tax optimization opportunities.

### Required Documentation
- Valid passport and residence permit
- Italian tax code (codice fiscale)
- Proof of Italian address (rental/ownership agreement)
- Notarized articles of association

## Taxation and Double Treaty Considerations

The **UK-Italy Double Taxation Treaty remains in force** post-Brexit, preventing double taxation on business profits, dividends, interest, and royalties. However, practical application requires careful planning:

- **IRAP (Regional Production Tax)**: 3.9-4.82% depending on region
- **VAT**: 22% standard rate, with reduced rates for specific goods/services
