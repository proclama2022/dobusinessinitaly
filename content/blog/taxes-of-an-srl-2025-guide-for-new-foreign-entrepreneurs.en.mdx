A **Limited Liability Company (SRL)** is one of the most commonly used forms of business in Italy. It has many advantages but also has **tax obligations**. Knowing them is essential for the success of your company.

## What is an SRL

An SRL is a capital company. This means that your personal assets are separate from those of the company. If the company has debts, your personal belongings are safe. This is a significant advantage.

To open an SRL, a minimum capital is required. Since 2022, only 1 euro is needed. However, it is better to have at least 10,000 euros. This gives you more credibility with banks and suppliers.

The SRL pays taxes on the income it generates. It doesn't matter if you take the money or leave it in the company. Taxes are paid regardless. This is different from other types of companies.

## Main Taxes of an SRL: Complete Overview for 2025

SRLs in Italy pay various types of taxes. Here are the four main ones:

| **Tax** | **Percentage** | **What it is paid on** | **News for 2025** |
|---------|----------------|------------------------|--------------------|
| **IRES** | 24% (or 20% for certain cases) | Company profits | Reduced IRES for some businesses |
| **IRAP** | 3.9% - 4.97% | Production value | Varies by region |
| **VAT** | 4%, 5%, 10%, 22% | Sales to customers | New digital rules |
| **INPS** | 24% - 26.07% | Compensation for directors | Increased minimum contribution |

💡 **Remember**: These are the main taxes. There are also other minor taxes that we will see later.

## IRES: The Tax on Profits

IRES is the most important tax for an SRL. It is paid on the taxable income of the company. Taxable income is the profit after deducting all costs.

The standard IRES rate is 24%. This applies for all of 2025. It is the same for all SRLs in Italy. It doesn't matter where your headquarters are located.

**News for 2025: Reduced IRES to 20%**
Companies that meet certain conditions can pay only 20% instead of 24%. The conditions are:
- Allocate at least 80% of the 2024 profits to a special reserve
- Invest at least 30% of these profits in "Industry 4.0" or "5.0" instrumental goods
- Not reduce the number of employees compared to the average of the previous three years
- Hire new permanent workers
- Not have used redundancy funds (except in exceptional cases)

To calculate IRES you need to:
1. Add up all revenues for the year
2. Subtract all deductible costs  
3. Multiply the result by 24% (or 20% if you qualify for reduced IRES)

### 📊 Practical Example of IRES Calculation

**SRL with a turnover of 100,000 euros:**
- Total revenues: 100,000€
- Deductible costs: 60,000€
- **Taxable profit: 40,000€**
- Standard IRES (24%): **9,600€**
- Reduced IRES (20%): **8,000€**
- **Savings with reduced IRES: 1,600€**

Deductible costs include: salaries, rents, materials, consulting fees, and depreciation. Not all costs can be deducted. Some have limits.

The IRES declaration is made every year. The deadline is November 30 of the following year. For example, for income in 2025, the declaration must be submitted by November 30, 2026.

IRES is paid in two installments. The first by June 30. The second by November 30. It can also be paid in a single payment by July 30.

## IRAP: The Regional Tax

IRAP is the Regional Tax on Productive Activities. It is a tax that varies from region to region. Each region decides its percentage.

IRAP is calculated on the net production value. This includes:
- Revenues from sales
- Inventory increases
- Work done for the company

Some costs can be deducted from the production value. But not all. For example, salaries and employee contributions are not fully deductible.

The base rate of IRAP in 2025 is 3.9%. Regions can increase it by up to 0.92 points. The main percentages are:
- Lombardy: 3.9%
- Lazio: 4.65%
- Campania: 4.97%
- Sicily: 4.97%
- Other regions: between 3.9% and 4.97%

Some activities pay less IRAP. For example, innovative start-ups receive discounts. Those who hire young people may also have reductions.

The IRAP declaration is made together with the IRES declaration. The payment deadlines are the same.

## VAT: The Consumption Tax

VAT is the Value Added Tax. It is not a tax you pay. Your customers pay it. You collect it and pay it to the state.

The VAT rates in Italy are:
- 4% for essential goods (bread, milk, medicines, books)
- 5% for some social and health services
- 10% for some services (transport, hotels, restaurants, domestic energy)
- 22% for everything else

When you sell a product or service, you add VAT to the price. The customer pays you the total. Every month or quarter, you pay the collected VAT to the Revenue Agency.

You can also deduct the VAT you pay for the company. For example, if you buy a computer for the office, you can deduct the VAT paid. This reduces the VAT to be paid.

To manage VAT you need to:
- Issue invoices with VAT
- Keep a record of sales
- Keep a record of purchases
- Make periodic settlements
- Submit the annual declaration

VAT deadlines are monthly or quarterly. It depends on the company's turnover. If you invoice less than 400,000 euros a year, you can choose the quarterly option.

## Social Security Contributions

The managing partners of an SRL must pay INPS contributions. Even if they do not take a salary. This has been a legal obligation since 2000.

**Two types of possible contributions:**

**Separate INPS Management** - For director compensation:
- Rate of 26.07% for professionals without other pension funds
- Rate of 24% if registered with other pension schemes
- Paid on compensation received as a director

**Merchant Management** - If you actively work in the company:
- Minimum fixed contribution: 4,549.70 euros for 2025
- Rate of 24.48% on income above 18,555 euros
- Paid in 4 installments: May, August, November, February

**Double Contribution**
If you are both a director AND actively work in the company, you must pay both contributions. This is the most expensive situation but also the most common.

Contributions are paid in four installments throughout the year. The deadlines are:
- May 16 (40% of the due amount)
- August 20 (20% of the due amount)
- November 16 (20% of the due amount)
- February 16 of the following year (20% of the due amount)

If you have employees, you must also pay their contributions. The percentage is different. It is about 33% of the gross salary.

## Other Taxes and Levies

In addition to the main taxes, an SRL also pays:

**Registration Tax** - Paid to register certain contracts. For example, rental contracts.

**Stamp Duty** - Paid on invoices over 77.47 euros. The amount is 2 euros per invoice.

**Municipal Taxes** - Each municipality has its own taxes. The most common is TARI (waste tax).

**RAI Fee** - If you have a TV in the office, you must pay the fee. It is 90 euros per year.

**Insurance Tax** - If you have insurance policies, you pay an additional tax.

These taxes are small. But it is important to know them. This way you avoid penalties and issues.
