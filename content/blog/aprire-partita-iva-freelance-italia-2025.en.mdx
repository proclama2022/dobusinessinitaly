## Requirements for Foreigners: EU vs Non-EU

Your nationality is the first factor to consider when deciding to start a freelance activity in Italy.

### European Union (EU) Citizens

If you are a citizen of a European Union country (or the European Economic Area, EEA, or Switzerland), the process is significantly simplified. You can start your activity under the same conditions as an Italian citizen, without particular bureaucratic constraints related to residence permits.

You will only need:
*   **Valid identity card** or passport.
*   **Registration with the registry office** of the Italian municipality where you intend to reside, if your stay exceeds three months.

### Non-EU Citizens

If you come from a non-EU country, the situation is more complex and requires obtaining a specific residence permit for self-employment. This is an indispensable step to carry out any independent professional activity.

Key steps include:
*   **Nulla-osta from the Chamber of Commerce:** You will need to demonstrate that you possess the necessary economic and financial capacity to start the activity, with a minimum amount updated annually (for 2025, verify the exact amount with the Chamber of Commerce or your accountant).
*   **Self-Employment Visa:** Required at the Italian Embassy or Consulate in your country of origin, after obtaining the nulla-osta.
*   **Residence Permit:** Once you arrive in Italy with the visa, you will need to apply for the residence permit for self-employment at the competent Questura (Police Headquarters).

## The VAT Number (Partita IVA): The Freelancer's First Step

The Partita IVA is the numerical code that identifies your professional activity and allows you to issue invoices and manage tax obligations. It is the first and fundamental step to becoming a freelancer in Italy.

### How to Apply for a VAT Number

The application for a VAT number is made to the Agenzia delle Entrate (Italian Revenue Agency), by filling out **Form AA9/12** (Declaration of commencement of activity, data variation or cessation of activity for VAT purposes). You can do this:
*   **Online:** Through the Agenzia delle Entrate's telematic services (requires SPID, CIE, or CNS).
*   **In person:** At any Agenzia delle Entrate office.
*   **Through an authorized intermediary:** The most common and recommended solution, by entrusting an accountant.

### Choosing the ATECO Code

When opening your VAT number, you will need to choose the **ATECO Code** that best describes your activity. This code is fundamental because it determines your profitability coefficient (in the flat-rate regime) and any specific requirements for your profession.

**Example:**
*   IT Consultant: 62.02.00 - IT consulting activities
*   Freelance Graphic Designer: 74.10.00 - Fashion design, industrial design, graphic design activities, etc.

It is crucial to choose the correct ATECO code, as it directly affects the calculation of taxes and the possibility of accessing certain tax regimes.

## Tax Regime: The Heart of Savings

Choosing the tax regime is the most important decision for a freelancer, as it determines how much tax you will pay. The **Flat-Rate Tax Regime (Regime Forfettario)** is the most advantageous option for most new freelancers.

### Flat-Rate Tax Regime 2025: The Flat Tax for Freelancers

The flat-rate tax regime is an advantageous tax regime that offers significant simplifications and a very low substitute tax.

**Access Requirements (2025):**
*   **Revenue/Compensation Limit:** Do not exceed **85,000 euros** in revenue or compensation in the previous year.
*   **Expenses for Employees/Collaborators:** Have not incurred expenses for employees or collaborators exceeding 20,000 euros gross.
*   **Employment Income:** Gross employment income or pension must not exceed 30,000 euros (if you also have a VAT number).

**Advantages:**
*   **Substitute Tax:** A single tax that replaces IRPEF, regional and municipal surcharges, and IRAP.
    *   **15%** on taxable income.
    *   **5%** on taxable income for the first five years of activity, if specific requirements are met (e.g., not having carried out business or professional activity in the previous three years).
*   **No VAT:** You do not apply VAT on your invoices and do not deduct it on purchases. This greatly simplifies accounting management.
*   **No IRAP:** You are exempt from paying the Regional Tax on Productive Activities.
*   **Simplified Accounting:** Fewer bureaucratic and accounting obligations.
*   **No obligation for electronic invoicing** (up to a certain turnover limit, but it is still recommended).

**How is taxable income calculated in the Flat-Rate Regime?**
It is not calculated by subtracting actual costs, but by applying a **profitability coefficient** to the total revenue/compensation. This coefficient varies based on the ATECO Code.

**Practical calculation example (with a 78% coefficient):**
*   Annual revenue: 30,000 euros
*   Profitability coefficient: 78%
*   Taxable income: 30,000€ * 78% = 23,400€
*   Substitute tax (5% for the first 5 years): 23,400€ * 5% = **1,170€**
*   Substitute tax (15% after 5 years): 23,400€ * 15% = **3,510€**

### Ordinary Regime (if not eligible for the Flat-Rate Regime)

If you do not meet the requirements for the flat-rate tax regime, you will have to operate under the ordinary regime (or simplified, depending on the turnover). In this case, you will be subject to:
*   **IRPEF:** Personal Income Tax, with progressive rates based on income brackets.
*   **VAT:** You will have to apply VAT on your invoices and pay it to the State, deducting the VAT paid on purchases.
*   **IRAP:** Regional Tax on Productive Activities (with some exemptions for professionals without an organization).

## Social Security Contributions: INPS Separate Management

For freelancers who do not have their own specific social security fund (e.g., lawyers, doctors, engineers with professional registers), registration with the **INPS Separate Management (Gestione Separata INPS)** is mandatory.

### Contribution Rate 2025

The contribution rate for professionals registered with the INPS Separate Management for 2025 is **26.23%** (composed of 25% for IVS - Disability, Old Age, and Survivors - and 1.23% for maternity, illness, etc.).

### Calculation and Payment of Contributions

Contributions are calculated by applying the rate to the taxable income (the same used for the substitute tax in the flat-rate regime).

**Example of contribution calculation (with taxable income of 23,400€):**
*   INPS Contributions: 23,400€ * 26.23% = **6,135.42€**

INPS contributions are paid with the same deadlines as the substitute tax:
*   **Advance payment:** Two installments (40% by June 30/July 20 and 60% by November 30).
*   **Balance:** By June 30/July 20 of the following year.

**Important:** Unlike artisans and traders, professionals registered with the Separate Management do not have a fixed minimum contribution, but pay only a percentage of the income actually produced. They do not benefit from the 35% reduction on contributions.

## Startup and Management Costs

Starting a freelance activity in Italy involves some initial and annual management costs.

### Initial Costs

*   **Opening a VAT Number:** Free if done independently, but it is highly recommended to rely on an accountant.
*   **Accountant:** For opening the VAT number and initial consultation, costs can range from **150 to 500 euros**, depending on the complexity and the professional.
*   **Digital Signature and PEC (Certified Electronic Mail):** Mandatory for communications with the Public Administration. Annual cost for PEC: **30-60 euros**. Cost for digital signature: **20-50 euros** (one-time or annual).

### Annual Management Costs

*   **Accountant:** The annual fee for managing a VAT number under the flat-rate regime generally ranges from **500 to 1,200 euros**, depending on the volume of invoices and the complexity of the activity.
*   **INPS Contributions:** As seen, calculated as a percentage of income.
*   **Substitute Tax:** 5% or 15% on taxable income.
*   **Minor Taxes:** Stamp duty on invoices (2 euros for invoices over 77.47 euros), TARI (waste tax, varies by municipality).
*   **Invoicing Software:** Many are free or low-cost, but good software can simplify management.

## Step-by-Step Procedure

Here is a simplified roadmap for starting your freelance activity in Italy:

1.  **Verify Residence Requirements:** Ensure you have the right to reside and work in Italy (residence permit for self-employment for non-EU citizens, registry registration for EU citizens).
2.  **Request your Tax Code (Codice Fiscale):** This is your tax identification in Italy, essential for any operation. You can request it at the Agenzia delle Entrate or the Italian Consulate abroad.
3.  **Choose an Accountant:** Find a professional specialized in freelance taxation and, if you are a foreigner, who has experience with international clients. They will guide you in choosing the tax regime and the ATECO Code.
4.  **Open your VAT Number (Partita IVA):** The accountant will handle filling out and submitting Form AA9/12 to the Agenzia delle Entrate.
5.  **Register with INPS Separate Management:** The accountant will automatically register you with the INPS Separate Management.
6.  **Activate PEC and Digital Signature:** Mandatory tools for official communications.
7.  **Open a Bank Account:** It is advisable to have a bank account dedicated to your professional activity. Many digital banks offer convenient solutions for freelancers.
8.  **Start Invoicing:** Once these steps are completed, you are ready to start your activity and issue your first invoices.

The entire process can take from a few weeks to a few months, depending on your nationality and the speed of document collection.

## Practical Tips for Foreign Freelancers

*   **Specialized Accountant:** Do not underestimate the importance of an accountant who understands the specifics of international taxation and the needs of freelancers. They will be your point of reference for any questions.
*   **Digital Bank Account:** Banks like N26 Business or Revolut Business can offer fast and convenient solutions for opening a business account, often with multilingual support.
*   **Electronic Invoicing:** Although not always mandatory for flat-rate taxpayers, electronic invoicing is the standard in Italy. Adopting software from the start will simplify your life.
*   **Continuous Training:** The Italian tax system can change. Stay updated by participating in webinars, reading guides, and interacting with other professionals.
*   **Networking:** Connect with the freelance community in Italy. There are online groups and associations that can offer support and opportunities.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

*   **Underestimating INPS Contributions:** Many freelancers focus only on taxes, forgetting that social security contributions represent a significant part of the tax burden.
*   **Not Verifying Flat-Rate Regime Requirements:** Exclusion clauses are important. Make sure you comply with them to avoid losing the benefits of the regime.
*   **Incomplete Documentation:** Especially for foreigners, missing sworn translations or legalizations can block the process.
*   **Doing Everything Yourself:** While possible, relying on an experienced accountant will save you time, errors, and potential penalties.
