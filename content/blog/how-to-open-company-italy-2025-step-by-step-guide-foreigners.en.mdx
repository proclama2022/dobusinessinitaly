## Frequently Asked Questions

### **Can I open a company in Italy remotely from abroad?**
Yes, most company formation steps can be completed remotely using Power of Attorney. However, some banks may require in-person meetings, and having an Italian representative or resident director can significantly simplify operations and banking relationships.

### **What's the difference between SRL and LTD companies?**
SRL (Italian limited liability) and LTD (UK limited liability) are conceptually similar but operate under different legal systems. SRL offers more flexibility in capital structure but requires Italian regulatory compliance. LTD companies operating in Italy must establish a subsidiary or branch.

### **Do I need an Italian partner to open a company?**
No, foreigners can own 100% of Italian companies without Italian partners. However, having local partners or advisors can provide valuable market knowledge, language assistance, and business network access.

### **How long does company registration take in 2025?**
Standard company formation takes 4-6 weeks for SRL, 2-3 weeks for SRLS, and 6-10 weeks for SPA. Remote processing may add 2-4 weeks due to document internationalization requirements.

### **What are the minimum capital requirements?**
SRL requires €1 minimum (€10,000 recommended), SRLS allows €1-9,999, and SPA requires €50,000. However, adequate capitalization should reflect business needs and industry standards.

### **Can I use my existing foreign company in Italy?**
Foreign companies can operate through Italian branches or must establish Italian subsidiaries. Branches are simpler but don't provide liability separation. Subsidiaries offer better protection but require full incorporation.

### **What ongoing compliance costs should I expect?**
Budget €3,000-6,000 annually for accounting services, €2,400-4,800 for registered office, plus banking, insurance, and administrative costs. Total annual compliance typically ranges from €8,000-15,000.

### **How do I choose the right ATECO code?**
Consult with your commercialista to select the appropriate ATECO code based on your primary business activities. The code affects tax rates, required licenses, and social security obligations.

### **Can I change my company type later?**
Yes, companies can transform from one legal form to another (e.g., SRL to SPA) as they grow. The process requires notarial deeds, shareholder approval, and regulatory filings.

### **What banking challenges do foreigners face?**
Foreigners often encounter more stringent KYC requirements, may need in-person visits, and face higher scrutiny for account opening. Working with specialist foreigner-friendly banks or using professional formation services can streamline the process.
