# How to open a business in Italy as a foreigner: complete guide 2026

Opening a business in Italy represents an extraordinary opportunity for many foreign entrepreneurs. Our country offers a dynamic market, interesting tax incentives, and increasingly simplified procedures. Whether you are a European citizen or a non-EU citizen, this guide will accompany you step by step towards the realization of your entrepreneurial project in 2026.

## Requirements for foreigners: EU vs non-EU

The first fundamental distinction concerns your nationality. If you are a citizen of an EU country, the process is much simpler. You can start your business under the same conditions as an Italian citizen, without particular bureaucratic constraints.

For the first three months, all you need is a valid identity card. After that, you will need to register with the registry office of the municipality where you intend to reside and make a declaration of presence at a police office. You will not need any specific residence permit for self-employment.

The situation changes significantly if you come from a non-EU country. In this case, you will need to follow a more detailed procedure:

### Specific Requirements for Non-EU Citizens

**1. Self-Employment Visa**
- Required from the Italian embassy in your country of residence
- Subject to annual "decreto flussi" (limited quotas available)
- Processing time: 4-8 weeks

**2. Chamber of Commerce Clearance (Nulla Osta)**
- Certificate attesting to your economic and financial capacity
- Requires demonstration of at least **23,532 euros annually** (updated 2025)
- Includes presentation of detailed business plan

**3. Self-Employment Residence Permit**
- Required within 8 working days of arrival in Italy
- Initial duration: 1-2 years, renewable
- Requires registration with the registry of Italian residents living abroad (AIRE)

**4. Additional Documentation**
- Certified translations and apostilles of all documents
- Comprehensive health insurance policy
- Suitable housing with registered rental contract
- Proof of additional capital availability beyond the minimum required

## The investor visa: a privileged path

If you have substantial capital, Italy offers a special program called the **Investor Visa**. This two-year visa is dedicated to those making strategic investments in our country. The minimum thresholds start from:

- **250,000 euros** for innovative startups
- **500,000 euros** for Italian capital companies
- **2 million euros** for government bonds

The process is fully digitalized through the government portal, with guaranteed response times within 30 days. Once you obtain the visa, you can travel freely in the Schengen area and reside in Italy for the entire duration of the permit.

## Which corporate form to choose

Choosing the legal structure is a crucial decision for the success of your business. Each corporate form has specific advantages and disadvantages that you must carefully evaluate.

### Sole proprietorship: simplicity and cost-effectiveness

The sole proprietorship remains the most economical solution to start. It does not require minimum capital, and the opening costs range between **150 and 300 euros** if you rely on an accountant. However, you must consider that you will be personally liable for business debts, a significant risk.

### Limited liability company: the most popular choice

The **SRL** (Società a Responsabilità Limitata) is the preferred corporate form for foreign entrepreneurs, and for good reasons. Although it requires a share capital of **10,000 euros** (you can start with just **1 euro** and reach the threshold gradually), it offers protection of personal assets and greater credibility with banks and suppliers—often resulting in 40-60% lower interest rates on business loans compared to sole proprietorships.

The total costs of incorporation range between **2,500 and 3,000 euros**, including notary fees, taxes, and accountant fees. This is an investment that pays off quickly due to the increased ease of access to financing and commercial contracts.

### Simplified SRL: the economical alternative

For those with limited budgets, the **SRLS** (Società a Responsabilità Limitata Semplificata) represents an interesting alternative. With a capital ranging from **1 to 9,999 euros** and reduced incorporation costs of only **320-410 euros**, it offers many advantages of the traditional SRL. The only limitation is the inability to customize the statute, as you must use a standard ministerial model.

## The most promising sectors for foreigners

Analysis of official data reveals interesting trends in the entrepreneurial choices of foreigners in Italy. **Commerce** remains the most sought-after sector, representing **25.5%** of new foreign businesses. Many choose:

- clothing stores
- specialty food stores focusing on ethnic products
- import-export activities leveraging connections with their countries of origin

The **construction** sector attracts **21.6%** of foreign entrepreneurs, often specializing in renovations incentivized by government building bonuses. **Personal services** also show steady growth, with particular success for:

- ethnic cuisine restaurants
- beauty centers
- domestic assistance services

📊 **Source**: According to the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) 2024 report, foreign entrepreneurs created over 400,000 businesses in Italy, representing 12% of total new companies, with a growth rate of 18% compared to the previous year.

## Flat-rate scheme 2025: the incentive not to miss

The flat-rate scheme represents one of the greatest attractions of the Italian tax system for small businesses. With the 2025 budget law, significant new features have been introduced that make this scheme even more interesting for foreigners.

- **maximum revenue limit**: 85,000 euros annually
- **employee income threshold**: increased to **35,000 euros**

This means that even those with a part-time job can open a flat-rate VAT number.

The taxation is extremely advantageous:

- only **15%** substitute tax
- which drops to **5%** for the first five years if you are under 35 and open a new business

For non-EU foreigners, access is possible as long as you reside in an EU country or the European Economic Area and generate at least **75%** of your income in Italy.

- POS for electronic payments: **10-30 euros** per month

These tools are now essential for any commercial activity.

## Step-by-step procedure

The opening process is divided into well-defined phases.

### Document preparation

This requires particular attention: all foreign documents must be **translated by official translators** and **legalized** with an apostille or by the Italian consulate.

- Costs: **25-50 euros** per page for translations
- **16-60 euros** for legalizations

### Choosing the corporate form

This should be made in consultation with a specialized accountant, who will be able to advise you on the best solution for your specific situation.

### Actual incorporation

- opening a VAT number
- registration with the Business Register
- registration with social security agencies

### Final phase

- opening a business bank account
- activation of mandatory digital services
- obtaining specific authorizations for your sector

The entire process generally takes **4-6 weeks** if everything is prepared correctly.
